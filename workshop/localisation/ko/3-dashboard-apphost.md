# Dashboard & Orchestration with .NET Aspire App Host

.NET Aspire provides APIs for expressing resources and dependencies within your distributed application. In addition to these APIs, there's tooling that enables some compelling scenarios. The orchestrator is intended for local development purposes.

Before continuing, consider some common terminology used in .NET Aspire:

* *App model*: A collection of resources that make up your distributed application (DistributedApplication). For a more formal definition, see Define the app model.
* *App host/Orchestrator project*: The .NET project that orchestrates the app model, named with the *.AppHost suffix (by convention).
* *Resource*: A resource represents a part of an application whether it be a .NET project, container, or executable, or some other resource like a database, cache, or cloud service (such as a storage service).
* *Reference*: A reference defines a connection between resources, expressed as a dependency using the WithReference API. For more information, see Reference resources.


## Create App Host Project

### Visual Studio & Visual Studio Code

1. Add a new project to the solution called `AppHost`:

	- Right-click on the solution and select `Add` > `New Project`.
	- Select the `.NET Aspire App Host` project template.
	- Name the project `AppHost`.
	- Click `Next` > `Create`.

	*Visual Studio Code*

### Command Line

1. Create a new project using the `dotnet new aspire-apphost` command:

	```bash
	dotnet new aspire-apphost -n AppHost
	```

## Configure Service Defaults

1. Add a reference to the `Api` and `MyWeatherHub` projects in the new `AppHost` project:

	- Right-click on the `AppHost` project and select `Add` > `Reference`.
		- Check the `Api` and `MyWeatherHub` projects and click `OK`.

	> Pro Tip: In Visual Studio 2022, you can drag and drop the project onto another project to add a reference.
1. When these references are add Source Generators automatically generate the necessary code to reference the projects in the App Host.


## Orchestrate the Application

1. In the `AppHost` project, update the `Program.cs` file, adding the following line immediately after the `var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);` line:

	```csharp
	var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api");

	var web = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyWeatherHub>("myweatherhub");
	```

## Run the application

1. Set the `AppHost` project as the startup project in Visual Studio by right clicking on the `AppHost` and clicking `Set Defaul Project`.
1. If you are using Visual Studio Code open the `launch.json` and replace all of the contents with the following:
	```json
	{
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Run AppHost",
                "type": "dotnet",
                "request": "launch",
                "projectPath": "${workspaceFolder}\\AppHost\\AppHost.csproj"
            }
        ]
    }
	```
1. Run the App Host using the `Run and Debug` panel in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio.
1. The .NET Aspire Dashboard will open in your default browser and display the resources and dependencies of your application.

1. Open the weather dashboard by clicking one the Endpoint for the `MyWeatherHub` which will be [https://localhost:7274](https://localhost:7274).
1. Notice that the `Api` and `MyWeatherHub` projects are running in the same process and can communicate with each other the same was as before using configuration settings.
1. Click on the `View Logs` button to see the logs from the `Api` and `MyWeatherHub` projects.
1. Select the `Traces` tab and slect the `View` on a trace where the API is being called.

1. Explore the `Metrics` tab to see the metrics for the `Api` and `MyWeatherHub` projects.

## Create an error
1. Open the `Structured` tab on the dashboard.
1. Set the `Level` to `Error` and notice that no errors appear
1. On the `MyWeatherApp` website click on several different cities to generate errors. Usually 5 different cities will generate an error.
1. After generating the errors, the `Structured` tab will automatically update on the dashboard and notice that the errors are displayed.

1. Click on the `Trace` or the `Details` to see the error message and stack trace.
